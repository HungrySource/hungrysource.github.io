Life Logger is an app to track activities in detail and to get insights from logs.
</p>
<p>
This screen lets you log activities. Tap on "Enter next activity" to start tracking.
</p>
<p>
Initially you will need to enter your activity manually by typing. After using the app for a while, suggestions would appear on this screen to let you log with a simple tap.
</p>

<p>
<span class="questions">"I made a mistake when I entered activities, how to fix it?"</span><br/>
You can go to the Reflect tab at the bottom, and tap on any previous activities to change the activity name. You can also tap on the start time to change the time, or swipe to remove.
</p>

<p>
<span class="questions">"Are my activities shared without my permission in any way?"</span><br/>
No. They are stored securely in iOS and not uploaded to any servers.
